## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical method used for analyzing the relationship between a categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is a type of regression analysis commonly used in machine learning and statistical modeling.

In logistic regression, the dependent variable is binary, meaning it can take only two values, typically 0 or 1. The independent variables, also known as features or predictors, can be continuous or categorical.

The logistic regression model estimates the probability of the dependent variable taking on a particular value given the values of the independent variables. The probabilities are modeled using a logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function, which maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1.

The logistic regression model fits a line that best separates the data points into two classes. This line is called the decision boundary or the logistic regression hyperplane. Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict the probability of the dependent variable taking on a particular value for new data points.

Logistic regression is widely used in many applications, including binary classification tasks, such as spam detection, fraud detection, and medical diagnosis. It is also used in multiclass classification tasks by using a variant called multinomial logistic regression.
