## Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm and not a regression algorithm. It is used to estimate discrete values (like 0 or 1, True or False, Yes or No) based on a given set of independent variables.

Logistic Regression produces results in a binary format that is used to predict the outcome of a categorical dependent variable. So the outcome should be discrete/categorical.
